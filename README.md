# Risk-Management

I will show different techniques to measure different types of risk whenever one is daytrading. The techniques covered, go as follows: (1) Market risk, (2) Portfolio risk, (3) VaR, (4) Monte Carlo simulations, (5) Hedging, (6) Basel regulation, (7) Credit risk, and (8) Fraud detection.

The code is partly based on Dr. Param Jeet's and Prashan Vats' book 'Learning Quantitative Finance with R'. I recommend it for those interested on learning more complex coding skills related to Quantitative Finance.
